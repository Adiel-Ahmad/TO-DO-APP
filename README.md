 Todo App  Kotlin with Firebase

 Overview

This is a Todo application developed in Kotlin for Android. It allows users to manage their tasks with features like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks. Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication, and Firebase Realtime Database is used for storing the tasks.

 Key Features:
 **User Authentication**: Sign in and Sign up using Firebase Authentication.
 **Task Management**: Add, Edit, and Delete tasks.
 **Task Synchronization**: Tasks are stored in Firebase Realtime Database and synchronized across devices.
 **EdgetoEdge UI**: Uses edgetoedge layout for a modern design.



 Project Structure

 1. **MainActivity**
 The entry point of the application, where the app UI is initialized.

 2. **Fragments**
 **homeFragment**: Displays the list of tasks from Firebase and allows users to add or update tasks.
 **signinFragment**: Allows users to sign in with their credentials.
 **signupFragment**: Allows new users to sign up for an account.
 **splashFragment**: Displays a splash screen and navigates to the signin screen or home screen depending on the authentication state.
 **ToDoDialogFragment**: A dialog for adding or editing tasks.

 3. **Adapters**
 **TaskAdapter**: RecyclerView adapter that binds the task data to the UI, allowing users to interact with tasks (edit, delete).

 4. **Models**
 **ToDoData**: A data model representing a task (task ID and task description).



 Dependencies

 **Firebase**: Used for user authentication and task storage.
 **RecyclerView**: For displaying tasks in a scrollable list.
 **Material Components**: For modern UI elements like buttons, text fields, and dialog fragments.



 Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/todoapp.git
   cd todoapp
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Add your Firebase project configuration:
    Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    Create a new project or select an existing one.
    Add an Android app to your Firebase project.
    Download the `googleservices.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory of the project.

4. Enable Firebase Authentication:
    In Firebase Console, go to the Authentication section.
    Enable "Email/Password" signin method.

5. Set up Firebase Realtime Database:
    Go to the Firebase Database section.
    Set up the Realtime Database rules. For development, you can use:
     ```json
     {
       "rules": {
         ".read": "auth != null",
         ".write": "auth != null"
       }
     }
     ```

6. Sync the project with Gradle:
    Android Studio will prompt to sync after adding Firebase dependencies. Make sure to click "Sync Now."

7. Run the application on your emulator or device.
